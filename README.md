# Photo-Editor
  The functioning of the application involves the application of some filters (Blur, Sharpen, Inverse etc.) on a certain image. 
  It consists of two windows: the first is an authentication window and the second is the actual image editor. Each filter is 
associated with a class in which is written the filter algorithm. 
  Finally, by pressing the button corresponding to the desired filter, in addition to applying the filter, it will create in the
project folder a .jpeg file that contains the image processed.
